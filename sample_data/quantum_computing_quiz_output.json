  "summary": "Aquantum computeris a (real or theoretical)computerthat exploitssuperposedandentangledstates. Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways that may be described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according todeterministicrules. (Aclassical computercan, in principle, be replicated by aclassical mechanical device, with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would requireexponentiallymore time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could performsomecalculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. F...",
