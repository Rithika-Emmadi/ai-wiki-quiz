  "summary": "Alan Mathison Turing(/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an Englishmathematician,computer scientist,logician,cryptanalyst,philosopherandtheoretical biologist.[6]He was highly influential in the development oftheoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts ofalgorithmandcomputationwith theTuring machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purposecomputer.[7][8][9]Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science.[10] Born in London, Turing was raised insouthern England. He graduated fromKing's College, Cambridge, and in 1938, earned a doctorate degree fromPrinceton University. DuringWorld War II, Turing worked for theGovernment Code and Cypher SchoolatBletchley Park, Britain'scodebreakingcentre that producedUltraintelligen...",
